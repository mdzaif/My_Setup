# Kubernetes architecture:

Master Node:
--> API server:
// Main gateway to access
// Central component of control plane
//Exposing APIs for user to k8s cluster interaction
//kubctl or web UIs use to interact with API server
//For validating request

--> Scheduler:
//scheduling pods on nodes
//schedular select node for the pods to run on
// based on config, and hardware requirements of pod, scheduler decides which node to use

--> Control Manager:
kube control-manager: if any node fails or unavailable it inform the report to master node for necessary action

//Node Controller: Monitor nodes
//Replication Controller: Maintains the correct replica count(mulitple replica of a pod)
//Service COntroller: Make sure all the services are properly configured
//Endpint Controller: Endpoints are properly configured


--> ETCD
//sotred logs 
// work as a database (key_value)

Working Node

--> Kubelet:
// run on each work node for managing the state of pods running on that node.
// kublet uses podspecs to create tand manage pods on the node
//PodSpecs is defined in JSON or YAML file
//Also makes sure container are running on pods

--> Kubeproxy:
//managing the networking aspect of cluster
//network config and rules

--> Container Runtime:
// work for running container( it is a software)
